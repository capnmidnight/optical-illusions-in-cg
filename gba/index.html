<h1>Nintendo GameBoy Advance</h1>

I will be implementing the graphical illusions as a simple game on the GBA. The GBA is particularly suited to rendering tilemaps, but is not very well suited to rendering curves, lacking any 3D or floating point processing. The illusions I am using are therefore a perfect match for the GBA, as they are merely tilemap data that looks curved.<br>

I've found a number of resources on developing for the GBA. As time progresses, I expect this page to become a rather good resource for any budding GBA developer. Most of these resources are fairly easy to find with google, it's just a matter of weeding them out from all the junk.<br>
